# Copy this file to .env (if you use .env) or otherwise load these environment variables into your runtime environment.

# Required: The URL where the AIQA API server listens
# Default: (none - must be set)
# Example: http://localhost:4001 or https://server-aiqa.winterwell.com
AIQA_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4001

# Required: The API key for authentication with the AIQA server
# Default: (none - must be set)
# Go to AIQA Webapp, click on your organisation, then click on "API Keys" to get your API key.
AIQA_API_KEY=

# Optional: Your organisation ID within AIQA
# Default: (empty - can also be passed programmatically)
# This is used when retrieving spans from the server. Not needed for tracing, which uses the API key to authenticate.
AIQA_ORGANISATION_ID=

# Optional: Component tag to add to all spans (e.g., "mynamespace.mysystem")
# Default: (empty)
# This allows you to filter by which component/system generated the spans - e.g. in the AIQA Traces view.
AIQA_COMPONENT_TAG=

# Optional: Sampling rate for traces (0.0 to 1.0)
# Default: 1.0 (sample all traces)
# Set to a value between 0.0 and 1.0 to sample a fraction of traces (e.g., 0.1 = 10%)
# Sampling is done based on the trace-id, so a whole trace is either sampled or not sampled.
AIQA_SAMPLING_RATE=1.0

# Optional: Maximum size for an object string representation in characters (i.e. max input / output size for a span)
# Default: 1m (1,048,576 characters)
# Supports units: k (kilo), m (mega), g (giga), or plain number
AIQA_MAX_OBJECT_STR_CHARS=1m

# Optional: Maximum number of spans to buffer in memory before sending to server
# When the buffer is full, new spans will be dropped and a warning will be logged.
# Increase this value if you generate many spans quickly and want to avoid drops.
AIQA_MAX_BUFFER_SPANS=10000

# Optional: How often to flush spans to the server in seconds
# Default: 5
AIQA_FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECONDS=5

# Optional: Maximum total buffer size in bytes (memory limit)
# Default: 100m
# When the buffer size exceeds this limit, the buffer will be flushed and a warning will be logged.
# This provides memory-based limiting in addition to span count limiting.
# Supports units: k (kilo), m (mega), g (giga), or plain number
# Example: 50m (50MB), 100m (100MB), 500k (500KB, which would be rather small)
AIQA_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE_BYTES=100m

# Optional: Comma-separated list of data filters to enable
# Available (and default) filters: RemovePasswords, RemoveJWT, RemoveAuthHeaders, RemoveAPIKeys
# Set to false to disable all filters. Empty string means use default filters.
AIQA_DATA_FILTERS=RemovePasswords, RemoveJWT, RemoveAuthHeaders, RemoveAPIKeys
